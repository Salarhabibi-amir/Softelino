                <h3>Why We Started?</h3>
                <p>There are two types of people in fire situation. The first type of people will leave the building immediately and save themselves, that is OK, everyone should do that. On the other hand, there are fire workers who challenge their lives
                    and dare to go against the fire and stop the fire in order to rescue people. Every Society needs these types of people to rescue others with their lives. So our responsibility is to train the young generation as if they are fire workers
                    and assign them to a big mission that is rescuing Our Community.

                <h3>What We Do?</h3>
                <p>We don’t care about software ideas and qualities, rather just we want to focus on improving each and every individual around us. Because if individuals are awesome anything they create will be out of the box.</p>

                    <p>Education enables upward socioeconomic mobility and is a key to escaping poverty. Over the past decade, major progress was made towards increasing access to education and school enrollment rates at all levels, particularly for girls.
                        Nevertheless, about 260 million children were still out of school in 2018 — nearly one fifth of the global population in that age group. And more than half of all children and adolescents worldwide are not meeting minimum proficiency
